# SVGbar.js

## What is SVGbar.js?
Well I'm glad you asked, random stranger! SVGbar.js will completely redefine what you think about progress bars **to this day.** It allows for you to make progress bars with SVG lines, shapes, paths, and more! It takes advantage of the `stroke-dasharray` and the `stroke-dashoffset` of any given SVG shape.

## Requirements
SVGbar.js requires jQuery. **You must include this file before you include the Javascript file.**

The latest version of jQuery can be downloaded [here](https://jquery.com/)

## Installation
Simply download the repository, and place the `SVGbar.js` in a really cool spot and the `SVGbar.css` in a really cool spot.

Place this somewhere in your head of your HTML file:
```html
<!-- Make the progress bars pretty -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/SVGbar.css">
```

And place this at the bottom of your body of your HTML file:
```html
<!-- jQuery best Query -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.0.min.js"></script>
<!-- Make the progress bars do stuff -->
<script src="path/to/SVGbar.js"></script>
```

## Demo
